## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-27

### Added
- **build**: parallel and wave execution — `/ck-code-lite:build T-02 T-05` builds
  independent tasks concurrently, one git worktree each, and `--waves` drives the whole
  remaining plan in dependency-ordered waves. Waves come from the plan's `needs` column,
  tasks declaring the same file never run together, and the orchestrator remains the sole
  writer of `tasks/PLAN.md` so concurrent branches cannot conflict on the plan table.
  RED, QA and manual sign-off all still gate a task before it is marked `done`.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-07-27

### Changed
- **start / README**: outgrowing lite now names the way out — `/ck-code:migrate` converts a
  lite project's `tasks/PLAN.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` to the full ck-code v4 layout,
  so the two-file workflow is no longer a dead end.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-27

### Added

- **start**: writes `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and a flat `tasks/PLAN.md` from a description,
  a spec file, or an existing codebase; re-runs append tasks without clobbering.
- **build**: implements one task end to end — a confirmed-failing test before any code,
  an isolated QA pass, and a manual sign-off before the task is marked done.
- **ship**: conventional commit plus pull-request create-or-update, with plain-language
  copy for non-engineers and no AI references in any artefact.
- **qa-validator** agent: runs the project's own commands in an isolated context and
  returns a per-criterion verdict plus one summary line, never the full suite output.
- Shared references for the plan-file format and manifest-to-command resolution.
